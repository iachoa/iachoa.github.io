 <h3>In-game description from the Adventurer Handbook</h3>
<p>A noble soul that watches over Wolvendom. When the safety of the wolves is threatened, it will take the form of a wolf and show its fangs and claws. It is said that its powers were given to it by an ancient archon.
</p>
<h3>In-game description from the Archive</h3>
<p>The noblest and greatest of souls, who watches over the lupical of Wolvendom.
When the wolfpack is imperiled, it will emerge in the form of a wolf and show forth its fangs and claws.

The wolves of Wolvendom are frightening phantoms to the people of Mondstadt:
A blurred shape flashing through the forest, a chilling howl in the indeterminate distance, the creeping sense of eyes constantly nailed on their backs...
Humans rarely have the oppotunity to lock their eyes with a wolf, for this is the law Lupus Boreas laid down for its race.

 <h3>In-game description from the Archive</h3>
<p>One of The Four Winds of Mondstadt: Dvalin, the Dragon of the East.
With the passages of long years and amid boudless darkness, even the purest gem will become dulled by dust, and even the noble dragon might be corrupted and cankered by hatred.
But never forget that dust can be wiped away, and the power of doubt and poison can be shattered.

"Fly freely in the sky.
"Just like you did in those days when we met, when I walked upon this land and sang the songs of the wind,
"And you soared on high, looking down on the world from above.
"Today, the sky is no longer swept by wind and snow. The green grass grows all over the earth, and it is beautiful.
"If you could walk on the earth and listen to the songs of shepherds and the scattered sound of the wind chimes in the distance, if you could have tasted wine as sweet as honey, you could understand.
"How wonderful it would have been if you were as I, witnessing your noble, beautiful form as you soared through the blue sky.
"Then you would know that this sky and this earth are both things worth fighting for."

 <h3>Archive</h3>
<p>"Childe" Tartaglia, Eleventh of the Fatui Harbingers. He draws power from the ominous Delusion he possesses and fights using martial arts that he learned in the land of darkness.

He is a pure warrior with an insatiable lust for battle. Each bloody conflict, each life-and-death struggle is a delightful trial for him. People say that the young Childe is famed throughout the land for his battle prowess. But he has never taken big talk of this kind to heart.

After all...
"You shall ever be the eye of the storm,"
"And the clashing of steel shall ever accompany you."
"The pitch-black memory of stepping into uttermost darkness,"
"Shall, at last, become the strength by which you will overturn this world."

 <h3>Archive</h3>
<p>An enormous dragon as ancient as the mountains themselves. In an age that has all but faded from memory, he stood shoulder to shoulder with one who ruled over a harbor of stone. But in the end, the two came into conflict, and the dragon was banished to a dark place deep underground.
Over the long years of his imprisonment, his power has slowly dissipated. He has also become disfigured from the various kinds of erosion he has been subjected to.
The faint rattling of this dragon lord's shackles and his deep, angry growl echo through the bowels of the mountains like memories of a bygone era.

 <h1>Signora</h1>
 <h3>Archive</h3>
<p>Signora, the Eighth of the Fatui Harbingers.
Unlike other Fatui who use the authority granted by Delusions, her Delusion is meant to shackle a flame that will devour everything. As opposed to a weapon used to kill, it might be more fitting to consider this a tool of imprisonment.
And it was the embers of that flame, which had accumulated over many long years, that would break through the frosty seal of the Delusion and apply a warped rouge upon her.

The crimson dawn was reflected in her pupils, and at last, she unfolded her flaming wings and flew towards the light.
"But that light is not the dawn, dear Rosalyne. That is a sea of flame that will consume everything."
A voice spoke to her amidst the light.

Yet it mattered not, for she knew in her heart that the flames had devoured her long ago.

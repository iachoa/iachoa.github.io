<div id="Inazuma">
<h1>Inazuma</h1>
<p>Inazuma (/ˌinəˈz(j)uːmə/, /iˈnɑːzumə/) (Japanese: 稲妻 Inazuma) is one of the seven nations in Teyvat. It is an archipelago nation that worships the Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon, who is also the leader of its governing body, the Inazuma Shogunate. Inazuma is located approximately 4 km southeast from Liyue Harbor.

In the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the Sakoku Decree. |"Baal" also enacted the related Vision Hunt Decree, declaring that Visions, as gifts from the gods, should be in the sole hands of divinity — and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God.[3]

Atsuko, an Inazuman who defected to Liyue, describes the country as having a "tense" and "dangerous" environment and discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the Kanjobugyo, one of the Tri-Commission, conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in order to be given permission to leave Inazuma. She bypassed those assessments by making her own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the Fatui seem to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.[4]

Access into Inazuma is unlocked after reaching Adventure Rank 30 and completing the first part of the Archon Quest Chapter II: Act I - The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia.

Archon Quest Chapter II: Omnipresence Over Mortals takes place in this nation.

In the secluded land of the immortal Shogun, the Bakufu rules eternal. But what do mortals see of the eternity chased after by their god?
